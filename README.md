# Introduction

Weather App (Hackathon Team 3) is a small responsive web app that shows current weather and a 5-day forecast, displays alerts, and includes an interactive map. Users can search for a city or use geolocation to get weather details (temperature in °C, humidity, wind, and description). The app integrates OpenWeatherMap for weather data and links to Met Office weather warnings for additional advisories.

# Responsivity

The app is built to work across a wide range of screen sizes using Bootstrap's responsive grid and a few custom CSS rules.
The site was fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop. Screenshots of https://ui.dev/amiresponsive running our website shown below.

The map shown at startup resizes dynamically to fit the screen.

## User Experience

### Strategy

Our strategy was to create a weather application that is intuitive, visually engaging, and accessible to users worldwide. We focused on delivering accurate weather information with interactive features such as map integration and dynamic backgrounds.

### Scope

The scope of this project included:

-   Providing real-time weather updates for any city globally.
-   Allowing users to search for locations or use their current geolocation.
-   Displaying weather information visually through cards, interactive map and colour and image changes based on weather conditions.
-   Ensuring the site is responsive and accessible.

Initially, we had thought to add a feature where users could see the weather from any past date (e.g. their location or street address). However, we discovered that the API that provided this infomation was only avaliable on a paid plan, so we pivoted to focus on the visual elements of the site e.g. the map.

### Structure

The structure of the site is simple as it is a one-page website with two navigations forecast and about. It includes a search bar at the top, an interactive heat-map button with auto-refresh under which weather cards are displayed, and buttons to select hourly and daily weather reports with update now button.

### Skeleton

Balsamiq Wireframes were used to plan the layout of the site.

As can be observed above, we had a framework for how we wanted to present the site & its key features.

Although simplistic, the added time allowed us to focus on UX by means of features & interactivity.

### Surface

## Design

From a design perspective, our main goal was to relay information the end-user visually.

To achieve this we included the following features:

-   Interactive map
-   Cards displaying weather information
-   Dynamic background
